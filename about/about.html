                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">A seasoned and standout event professional in the northern
                        California wedding industry, Alex
                        Quintana puts experience at the center of what he does. From his polished and no-drama approach
                        to planning events to a deep appreciation for hosting anyone who’s ready to chat over a
                        cappuccino (or two), one thing is for sure—Alex is dedicated to a process built on integrity and
                        service excellence.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">His heartfelt desire to create magic for his clients has earned
                        him the shining reviews that mean the most to him—those of his clients, vendor partners, and
                        venues. A leader and lover of logistics, Alex is always mindful to mix his passion with patience
                        (and a bit of humor) because there is nothing better than the handshakes and hugs of grateful
                        clients and an energized team.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">When Alex isn’t bringing people together in wine country, you’ll
                        find him indulging in tapas, at the local farmer’s market, exploring the great outdoors with his
                        wife and son or daydreaming about his next trip to Italy.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">Since joining in 2014, Heather’s gifts of organization, concept
                        design and contagious enthusiasm have earned her an ever-increasing role in planning and
                        coordinating numerous Quintana Events weddings. As part of our Senior Team, Heather plays a
                        vital role in the direction and strategic planning within the company. Combining her unique eye
                        for design, over 8 years of wedding coordination & experience in venue and catering management,
                        Heather knows how to plan & execute truly unforgettable events. She strives to bring her
                        clients’ visions to life & make their wedding day as fun & worry-free as possible.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">She is a Sonoma County local of 9+ years, having graduated from
                        Sonoma State with a Communication & Media Studies Degree. When Heather is not busy planning
                        weddings, she enjoys spending time with her husband & dog in their Petaluma home, doing yoga,
                        cooking, reading, visiting local restaurants, breweries & wineries, & browsing the Target home
                        decor section.</p>

                    <p class="web-color">Senior Event Producer</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">A maestro when it comes to logistics, Stephanie began working with
                        Quintana events in 2018. A 2012 graduate of Arizona State University, she holds a degree in
                        Tourism Development and Special Events Management.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">Prior to stepping into the wedding industry, she worked in the
                        Athletic Events industry helping to produce some of the largest triathlons in the world, managed
                        registration and production for corporate events, and worked with mobile catering to produce
                        large food trucks events. Her love for weddings came from working as a private estate venue
                        manager in Sonoma and Napa.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">As an event producer with Quintana, Stephanie loves the overall
                        creation of turning a blank canvas into a beautiful event space. Her calm energy comes from
                        being prepared with well-thought-out contingency plans and focusing on solutions. She’s
                        especially adept at vendor relationships and making sure the clients’ ideas really shine
                        through. As part of our Senior Team, Stephanie plays a vital role in the communications and
                        strategic planning within the company.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">Well traveled, Stephanie was born in Arizona but has lived in
                        Pennsylvania, Las Vegas, and the San Francisco Bay Area before settling in Northern California
                        in 2020. She and her husband have two little girls that keep them very busy at home. They enjoy
                        all things outdoors including hiking, camping, the beach and exploring all the local wineries
                        and craft breweries.</p>

                    <p class="web-color">Event Producer</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">Kate’s affinity for event planning began in 2008, coordinating
                        corporate events at Stanford University.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">A few years later, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona and has
                        enjoyed wedding planning in the desert ever since.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">Over the past 10 years, she has collaborated with clients to make
                        their dreams come true, whether that be an intimate elopement overlooking the Grand Canyon, or a
                        large scale ballroom event.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">Kate is thrilled to have returned to California, in order to be
                        closer to family. Northern California is “home” and she can’t wait to create magical events in
                        such a special place. She has a knack for logistical challenges, staying calm under pressure,
                        and she truly loves to get to know her clients throughout the planning process. She will work
                        with you to identify what your priorities are, and will offer guidance and care to make sure you
                        (and your guests!) are amazed on wedding day.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">Kate got married in 2016 in Sonoma, and she and her husband have a
                        3 year old son. She enjoys yoga, exploring new happy hour spots, being in nature, and soaking in
                        time with her family.</p>

                    <p class="web-color">Production & Project Manager</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">Whether it’s making her home a cozy safe haven, choosing an
                        intimate romantic restaurant for date night, or curating a fun upbeat picnic with friends – she
                        knows how to create just the right ‘vibe’ for any occasion. This innate talent made her
                        transition into events a no brainer. Simone began in the industry 6 years ago, where she worked
                        in a variety of roles supporting the corporate and tech spaces. She joined Quintana in 2021 and
                        hasn’t looked back since! Her attention to detail and can-do attitude has her constantly wearing
                        different hats from managing production tasks to leading staff and vendors on the day-of.</p>

                    <p class="fs-5 lh-base web-color">Simone was born and raised in San Francisco and attended Sonoma
                        State University where she got her degree in Communications and Media Studies. After college she
                        moved back down to the Bay Area where she currently resides. When Simone isn’t on the job she
                        loves to travel (anywhere and everywhere!), hit up a yoga class, try all the international
                        cuisines the Bay Area has to offer, and spend time outdoors in the sun.</p>

                            perfectly choreographed, yet felt natural. The vineyard dinner setting was beautiful during
                            dinner but, after dark, it was like out of a movie!”</p>
